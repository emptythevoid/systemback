# Systemback for Ubuntu

This is a repository for the latest version of Systemback for Ubuntu.  
Systemback has been abandoned by it's author, so you use this software at your own risk.
I provide no guarantees that this will work.

## A note about the original package

The original Systemback tar.xz file contained an install.sh file that would attempt to detect
which release you were using. This script has never been updated for newer versions of Ubuntu.
This repackaging I've created skips the install script entirely.

## Getting Started

Download the .zip file and extract it.  Navigate to it and run this command to install all the deb files:

sudo apt install ./*.deb

This should automatically install any required dependencies
